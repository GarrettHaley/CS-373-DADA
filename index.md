## Week 1

#### Anti-malware History

Commercial anti-virus did not come out to the market until the early 1990's. Careers were hard to combe by in computer antivirus research. The primary jobs market was to work for the computer antivirus research organization formed in 1990. The market now has over 10 billion invested in the endpoint security market.

#### Why does malware exist?

The primary reasons for malware existing generally falls under political or economic gain, defacement/destruction, and reconnaissance/spying.

#### What are the roles of an anti-malware researcher?

The primary role of an anti-malware researcher is to follow best practices, etiquette and safe computing. Futher the researcher should be able to understand a describe the threat, create countermeasures, and approach the design from an anti-attacker perspective.

#### Basic Malware/Security Definitions:
1. White - Clean malware.
2. Black - Dirty malware.
3. Grey - Unsure.
4. Sample - Peiece of malware.
5. Goat - What you ar giving the malware (i.e virtual machines, etc).
6. Bootkits - Master boot record infection. Hidden encrypted disk partition where malware and rootkits are executed. These were popular in the 1980's (malware popularity type comes in waves).
7. Trojan horse - Masquerades as useful software but once installed, often create a backdoor to your computer that gives malicious users access to your system, possible allowing confidential or personal information to be compromised.
8. Spyware - Software that collect personal information without the user’s knowledge or consent for advertorial or fraudulent purposes. 
9. RATS - Remote Aceess Tools System Software.
10. CVE - The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures. 
11. Ransomeware: Software which encrypts users files and will unencrypt them if a user is willing to pay for them.
12. Static Analysis:performed without the benefit of dynamic execution environment. Pros: Discover what the author intended the code to do, even if that can not be observed in lab environment. Cons: Can be expensive; out of context and external dependencies can not be evaluated.

#### Malware naming conventions:
The naming convention is as follows: Type:->Platform/->Family->.Varient->!Information
example: Trojan:Win32/Reveton.T!Ink

#### Advanced Persistent Threats:
Term created in 2006 by US Air-force analysts, Describes three aspects of attackers that represent their profile, intent, and structure:
Advanced – The attacker is fluent with cyber intrusion methods and administrative techniques, and is capable of crafting custom exploits and related tools.
Persistent – The attacker has an objective (or mission in longer-term campaigns) and works to achieve their goals without detection.
Threat – The attacker is organized, receives instructions, is sufficiently funded to perform their (sometimes extended) operations, and is motivated.

#### Characteristics of an APT:
Actors
Motives
Targets
Goals

#### Actors:
Terrorists/activists
Governments
Organized crime groups
Competitors
Malicious insiders/ex-employee

#### Motives:
Money
Disgruntlement or revenge
Ideology
Excitement

#### Targets:
Large corporations
Governments
Defense Contractors
Anyone

#### Goals:
Use stealth during intrusion to avoid detection
Create backdoors to allow greater access, especially if other access points have been discovered and patched
 Initiating the primary mission:
Stealing sensitive data
Monitoring communications
Disrupting operations
 Leaving undetected
